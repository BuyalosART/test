sup i'm back it's 2021

[x] remember how to deploy / update this monster

[ ] are the mobile styles good? should they be on by default?
	"docked to bottom" vs "fatter controls for fingers not cursors" 
	(should these be coupled?)

[ ] finish last 3 sections of guide
[ ] finish the 'todoc' code examples in API
[ ] order of properties (not methods) is kinda wonky

[ ] massage API list/toc index: too scary looking
	[ ] methods (purple)
	[ ] public vars (blue)
	[ ] private vars (blue / not bold?)

[ ] position/progress indicator on index/toc

[ ] examples
	[ ] figure out which to keep which to kill
	[ ] figure out where to link these on homepage
	[ ] check up on pixi/threejs sandboxes

todo

[ ] i don't want to see that inline --max-height style until i've dragged

[ ] right click to reset sliders
[ ] vertical drag on number fields
[ ] limit break

title drag
	[ ] mouse (this conflicts with open)
	[ ] prevent default for touch (this still conflicts with scroll)
	[ ] constraints

docs
	[x] -> this type chainable comeback
	[n] transform ugly longnames

	[-] gui.addColor won't read hsl formats
