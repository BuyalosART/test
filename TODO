[ ] unit test for import/export recursive=false
[ ] close() should accept a parameter like disable() for symmetry with open()

[ ] listen() 0 - 1, slider knob stops moving around zero...

[ ] per example "toast" / intro: dismissable modal with explanation & back link

homepage

[ ] MIGRATING

[ ] GUIDE
	[ ] Folders
	[ ] ctrl.onChange
	[ ] gui.onChange
	[ ] Mobile Styles
	[ ] Customization

OTHER
	[ ] order of properties (not methods) in API is kinda wonky
	[ ] update anchor positions on resize
	[ ] main api toc columns are ugly

sup i'm back it's 2021

[x] no demo gui on mobile: annoying, conceals intro
[x] --hover-color should return...

[x] unit test for gui.onChange

[x] export should yell at you if you have collisions
[x] import should yell if you don't have .controllers

[x] gui.onChange
[x] themes dont work with new load export format

[x] massage API list/toc index: too scary looking

[x] examples
	[x] toc link?
	[x] figure out which to keep which to kill
	[x] figure out where to link these on homepage
	[x] check up on pixi/threejs sandboxes

[x] why is live-server refreshing on .git

[x] i don't like the way import export works
	it should reflect folder hierarchy somehow
	lest name collisions become nightmarish

[x] position/progress indicator on index/toc
[x] scroll toc item into view on scroll if highlighted section not visible
	[x] ...would be nice to include margin top of first h1

[x] remember how to deploy / update this monster

[x] are the mobile styles good? should they be on by default?
	"docked to bottom" vs "fatter controls for fingers not cursors" 
	(should these be coupled?)

stale todos from 2019

[ ] i don't want to see that inline --max-height style until i've dragged

[ ] right click to reset sliders
[ ] vertical drag on number fields
[ ] limit break

title drag
	[ ] mouse (this conflicts with open)
	[ ] prevent default for touch (this still conflicts with scroll)
	[ ] constraints

docs
	[x] -> this type chainable comeback
	[n] transform ugly longnames
	[x] logical, not alphabetical order...
	hardstuff
		[ ] GUIOptions
		[ ] gui.add
		[ ] step
		[ ] export/import

tests

[x] define blank methods for controller (min,max,step,options)
	[x] that's done ... test it?

dat-gui diffs (for documentation)

	[+] "mobile styles"

	[+] controller.enable() / disable()
	
	[m] folders open by default

	[m] gui.remove( controller ) => controller.destroy()
	[m] gui.removeFolder( folder ) => folder.destroy()

	[m] built in color controller => input[type=color]

	[m] .__controllers => gui.children
	[m] .__folders => gui.children
	
	[m] color objects and arrays expect rgb values in the range of 0 - 1, not 0 - 255.

	[-] gui.addColor won't read hsl formats
	[-] gui.addColor won't parse css strings aside from '#rrggbb'
		now more, but still not all

	[-] "presets", gui.remember(), etc.
		(you can have two folders with the same name!)
	
	[-] multiple autoPlace gui's
	
	[-] gui.hide() / gui.show()
	[-] press H / GUI.hideAll(), etc.
